# Computer-Interface-Programming
Computer interface serves as a layer between the end user and the technical functionality of a computer system.  A good interface design ensures the ease of use for any computer systems.  This course will enable students to participate in the design as well as development of a system.  It incorporates the essential concepts of a well-planned system that emphasis on the user interface design.



Assignment  –  1 [Don Norman.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Computer-Interface-Programming/files/7598896/Don.Norman.pdf)

In this assignment, you will develop sketches of your interface designs (Via Figma). That is, you should provide pencil-and-paper or electronic images of the interface at various stages; you do not need to build a working prototype. Your design sketches should be sufficiently detailed for a potential user to provide useful feedback about the design, however. Most importantly, you should also include your justifications for why design decisions were made, and what you consider to be the relative strengths and weaknesses of your different designs.
*Main UI design principles and guidelines applied
*select between Norman’s 7 principles and Schneiderman’s 8 golden rules to justify your sketches.

Assignment  – 2 [Nielsen's 10 Heuristics Principle.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Computer-Interface-Programming/files/7598901/Nielsen.s.10.Heuristics.Principle.pdf)

Based on Nielson’s 10 usability Heuristics principles, evaluates your works in 1. For each principle support with specific design sketches.

NOTE: Provide an overview of your design, guiding me through its major points, and how a user would interact with it to do the task(s). Note that I'll be looking for features of usability, but also how your design adheres to the assumptions you made about the context, users, tasks, etc. So if you make decisions in your design that you want me to notice, make them explicit. 




PRESENTATION [Group C Mini Project.pdf](https://github.com/kitkatlky/Computer-Interface-Programming/files/7598916/Group.C.Mini.Project.pdf)

The purpose of this assignment is to give you a bit of practice with the design of everyday things.
Find a common household appliance (in your house) with a control scheme that has not changed much in decades or refer to these URL’s address (for example).
https://www.senq.com.my/search/?q=OVEN
https://www.senq.com.my/search/?q=toaster

Deliverable
Take a good photo or set of photos of the appliance showing the interface (e.g. the door and the controls). Note how to use the various controls either on the photos or next to them.

    •	Overall layout
    •	Closeup of the handle to open and close the door (if any)
    •	Closeup of the controls 
    •	List your most common uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
    •	Think about how the user interacts with the appliance. What is the sequence of actions to make for example toast or heat a frozen pizza?
    •	How does the appliance help the user figure out how to make it work?
    •	How does the appliance show the state of the system to the user?
    •	How easy is it for a guest to use this appliance?
    •	What are some common mistakes you can make with this design?
    
Discuss what is good and bad about the design, the mapping, the use of language or symbols, how accessible it is, etc. 
Think about some possible improvements using current physical controls (e.g. knobs, buttons), draw some sketches of your improved interface, and discuss those improvements.

In this assessment, 

Task 1
You have been hired to design an interactive system to facilitate patient-geriatrician communication during the pandemic/MCO. As part of your design process, you are in charge of creating the personas. You must determine who those personas are and create two of those personas.

Use your lecture notes and any references to create your personas. Refer to the example provided in class as needed. Each persona MUST be a full page.

For this assignment, your group will develop the scenarios and personas that will guide the design and implementation of your Mobile PC Application.  Each group will construct one user persona that represents their primary user and at least 1 scenario of how the persona will use your application to do the desired task.  

Your persona and scenarios will be submitted as a website on your group's project webspace. Both the persona and the scenarios are part of the portfolio your group is building.  With this in mind, feel free to be creative, but make sure that the persona's goals are well specified and the scenarios are well thought out.

Recommended that each person works individually to come up with a persona and some scenarios BEFORE the group meets.

Turnin details:  webpage(s) containing your persona and scenarios (ANY FREE WEB EDITOR)

Your persona must include:

  •	A name
  •	A picture or pictures. 
  •	Goals:  What does this person want to do? 
    For example, I will still need to grade homework even if it is submitted electronically instead of on paper. *** This is a critical part of your persona ***
  •	Background of computer skills and abilities.  How much experience does your persona have with computers? How often does he/she use them?
  •	Personal Background,  How old is your persona,  In school? Working? Does he/she have a family, What does he/she do when not working?
  •	A description of a day in life:  Outline a typical day for your persona.
  •	Additional Reference:  One report, news article, a market research report that your group used to gather additional data to inform your persona design. 
  •	Other... additional details that seem helpful for understanding your persona.
  
  
Task 2
•	Create an HTA and state chart diagram for Task 1.
